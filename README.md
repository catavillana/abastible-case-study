**Abastible Case Study - Community Building from Scratch**

**The Challenge**
As Digital Director at Los Quiltros, I built Abastible's Facebook community from zero, competing against Lipigas with minimal budget and initial client skepticism.

**Our Mission**
"Reclaiming Chilean identity through its people, traditions, humor, and cuisine - delivering warmth and energy through authentic connections."

**Key Results**
- **181,000 Facebook fans in less than a year** (42% organic growth)
- **Record post**: 825,000 reach with only $5,000 CLP invested
- **Extraordinary ROI**: 859,200% return ($43M CLP value created)

Featured Campaigns
- **"The Chilean Knows"**: 825K reach, 45K reactions, 12K shares
- **"Neighborhood Traditions"**: 620K reach, 38K comments, 8.5K shares

Methodology
Social Listening → Agile Content Production → GA4 Optimization
